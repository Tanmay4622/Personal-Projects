Game of battleships inside the terminal made with C language 

WIP

progress so far:
 -player need to chose 2 points on the board in the format 'A1B1' where were 'A1' and 'B1' will be the starting and end points of ship.

 -a unbiased random grid will be generated as opponent.

 -the player and computer take turns to attack.

 -first side to lose all ships loses.


Ideas to be added:

 -smart targetting for the computer's attack turn. (computer shoots randomly as of now)
 -message display when a ship is sunk.
